When we use the order i j k , for each entry Cij in the resulting matrix, we multiply the row i of A by the column j of B , so for each element in this column we bring the entire row it benlongs to from RAM to Cash,so when calculating Cij we bring the entire matrix B from RAM to cash, this means at the end we fetch the matrix B N*N times from RAM to cache , which is too expensive , however , when using the order i k j , it is like we save the transpose of the matrix B in the RAM , so we deal with (row * row operations), so for each row of B that we fetch from RAM to Cash , we use all its values in the same operation , using this way we fetch the matrix B only N times , (As N increases the order i k j will be far better than the order i j k)
